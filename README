=========================================================================

This repository contains the general purpose files for use in the
modeling of the network and mission space models. These files are used
for a variety of purposes and are put in a number of different
directories.

Directory:

communications : directory that contains files used for handling the
	         communication between different processes that are
	         part of the larger simulation.

communications/c++ : c++ files that are used to facilitate the
                     communications. (This needs to change but will do
                     for now. We should divide this up into other
                     subdirectories once we figure out the different
                     functionalities that we will need to implement.)
